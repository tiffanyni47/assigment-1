      Rabbits are small, furry mammals known for their long ears, strong hind legs, and twitching noses. 
      They are social and active creatures, often found in grasslands, forests, and even as pets in homes. 
      With their rapid reproduction and keen survival instincts, rabbits play a vital role in ecosystems around the world.
