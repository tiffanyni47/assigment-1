      The Northern Long-tailed Tit (Aegithalos caudatus caudatus) is a distinctive subspecies of the long-tailed tit, 
      primarily found in Northern Europe, Russia, and Hokkaido, Japan. It is known for its fluffy, round body and pure white head, 
      earning it nicknames like "snowball" or "forest fairy" due to its incredibly cute appearance. While not classified as endangered, 
      habitat loss and extreme weather conditions can impact its population in certain areas, making it a rare sight in some regions.
