      The Volcano Rabbit (Romerolagus diazi) is one of the worldâ€™s smallest and rarest rabbit species, 
      native to the high-altitude volcanic slopes of central Mexico. It has a round, chubby body, tiny ears, 
      and thick fur, which help it survive in cold mountain habitats. Due to habitat destruction and human activity, 
      it is considered endangered, making sightings of this adorable rabbit increasingly rare.
