      The Polar Bear (Ursus maritimus) is the largest bear species and a powerful marine mammal, 
      native to the Arctic regions of North America, Europe, and Asia. With its thick white fur, 
      insulating fat, and strong swimming ability, it is perfectly adapted to the icy environment, 
      where it primarily hunts seals. However, due to climate change and melting sea ice, polar bears are increasingly vulnerable, 
      making conservation efforts critical for their survival.
