    The Bawean deer (Axis kuhlii), also known as the Bawean hog deer, is a rare and endangered species found only on Bawean Island in Indonesia. 
      It is a small deer with a stocky build, short legs, and a reddish-brown coat, well-adapted to the islandâ€™s dense forests. 
      Due to habitat loss and a limited population, conservation efforts are crucial to ensuring its survival.
